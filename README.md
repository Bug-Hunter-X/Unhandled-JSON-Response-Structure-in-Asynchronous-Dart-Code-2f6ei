# Unhandled JSON Response Structure in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart when handling asynchronous API calls and JSON responses. The `bug.dart` file contains code that attempts to access a JSON response without verifying its structure, leading to potential runtime errors. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling and structure verification.

## Bug Description

The primary issue lies in the assumption that the JSON response from the API will always have a specific structure.  The code lacks checks to handle unexpected JSON structures, such as null values or unexpected data types.

## Solution

The solution involves adding checks to validate the JSON response's structure before attempting to access its elements.  Type checking and null checks are crucial to prevent unexpected behavior.
